# Note: Only set "working-copy" on non-production sites. This flag preserves 
# scm directories (e.g. .git), allowing you to commit changes to your code.  
# However, it also bypasses drush make's caching system, slowing down 
# deployments. So, because of this and because you shouldn't be directly 
# editing production code, only pass working-copy to development environmnents.
